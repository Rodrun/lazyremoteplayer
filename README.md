#Lazy Remote Player
==================

Server to play multiple types of media (online or local) from a queue.

#Setup
=====

##Install

`npm install`

##Port setup

`PORT=12345`

If not set, defaults to `3000`.

##Run

`npm start`

##Use

Connect to `localhost:PORT`, where `PORT` is whatever port you set it to. You could perhaps portforward your host device so you could use it externally, however, no security features are currently implemented (passwords/accounts etc.).
